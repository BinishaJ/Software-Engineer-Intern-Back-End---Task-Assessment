# General Questions

1. What excites or interests you about coding? What did you learn this week?

   > I describe myself who is more into logics and not so much of a creative thinker. As a person who has been interested in using computers, I chose the Computer Field for my studies. And as time passed and I learnt more about myself and coding, I realized that I am amongst those who loves to code rather than thinking about the design aspects and all those. When I code, I think about how this will work, why this isn't working, will it work if I do this instead of this, think about it, if there are bugs in the code I tend to be thinking about how to solve it every time until I am finally able to solve it. So basically I think that my characteristics and personality is more suited for coding.
   > I am a final year student of BSc. CSIT, so we have to complete a final year project in our 7th Semester and my project is based on machine learning and deep learning. So this week, I researched and gained knowledge about those aspects, training a model and all those functionalities.

2. What is a recent technical challenge you experienced and how did you solve it?

   > As I mentioned in my previous answer about my project, machine learning and deep learning is a complete new thing for me as I have no knowledge about how it works. So developing and training a model was a huge task. I watched many numerous videos, learnt about it from other projects, consulted with my teachers and I am currently working on it.

3. Talk about your preferred development environment (tools and technologies you prefer using) or a cool project that you've recently worked on (if any).

   > I prefer using Visual Studio Code as my code editor. I find it really easy to use and all the functionalities and extensions to complete various tasks are available in it. I started with ReactJS for more than a year and then I realized that frontend and designing doesn't suit me that much, so I decided to switch to backend and what better than Node.js for someone who has already learnt JavaScript. I have been doing Node.js for a few months, learning off basics and then implementing some small projects. Recently I have been working on Web Scrapping project.

4. What is your general expectation from this internship program?

   > Firstly I want to be involved in a company where I can grow myself and gain some knowledge about the real-world and how it works. I would be very happy and grateful if there is someone who can play a mentor role, who can help me in different things related to this field with their knowledge as I am just starting.

5. What mediums do you prefer to learn programming?
   > I have been learning from YouTube till now, everything about the basics to whatever that I know right now, by watching videos from various channels. I had also enrolled in few Udemy courses which were helpful. I also so much through my teachers and other people around me who have some experience in the field which has been really helpful and I had also joined few webinars as well. So I don't that medium is of importance, the more important thing is learning and gaining knowledge.
